## Full Setup with MongoDB Atlas

When you're ready to use the full version with persistent data:

1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas** (see README.md for detailed instructions)
2. **Switch to full version** by changing `src/App.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   import BadmintonManager from './components/BadmintonManager'
   // instead of DemoBadmintonManager
   ```
3. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Configure environment variables** (see README.md)
